<h1 id="synaptic-plasticity-of-basal-ganglia-neurons">Synaptic Plasticity of Basal Ganglia Neurons</h1>
<p>Human brain supports various forms of memory and learning in its various subparts. This is for instance the case of the basal ganglia, a set of subcortical nuclei that is involved in action selection, and a specific form of learning / memory, procedural memory (memory of skills or expertise). At the scale of single neurons, the most plausible support of learning and memory is synaptic plasticity, i.e.Â the activity-dependent modification of the weight between two connected neurons. In particular, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), whereby weight change is dictated by the time delay between presynaptic and postynaptic action potentials, has attracted much attention from theoretical and experimental communities. However, at the molecular scale, this phenomenon and its dependence on underlying signaling pathways are not yet understood. To address this issue, we combine experimental methods (pharmacology and electrophysiology) with modeling (ODE model of the implicated signaling network).</p>
